## Dependencies

In order to properly use my configs you'll need a few packages. I'm currently using the following:
- vim
- i3-gaps
- polybar
- dmenu
- python-pywal
- compton
- i3lock
- urxvt

## randwall.py

This short script chooses a random wallpaper from ~/Pictures/Wallpapers and sets the theme with pywal. This also is useless as pywal will select a random image if you point it at a directory.
